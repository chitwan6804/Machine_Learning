# Machine_Learning

## Project Overview

This repository contains a collection of machine learning models implemented in Python. It is intended as a resource for learning and understanding various machine learning algorithms, with examples and practical implementations. The projects are organized by algorithm type, such as KNN, Decision Trees, Neural Networks, and more.

## Contents

This repository is structured into folders, each focusing on a specific algorithm or project:

### 1. Basics
   - **Description**: Introduction to Python and NumPy basics, providing a foundation for data manipulation and mathematical operations.

### 2. KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)
   - **Description**: Implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm. Projects include Handwritten Digits Recognition, Dating Model demonstrating how KNN can be applied to classification problems.

### ADABOOST
   - **Description**: Implementation of the AdaBoost algorithm, an ensemble learning method that combines multiple weak classifiers to create a strong classifier. Includes a project using a dataset for Horse Colic.

### Decision Trees
   - **Description**: Implementation of decision tree models for classification tasks. Includes a project using a dataset for lenses, and checking is it a fish?.

### Heart Disease
   - **Description**: Predictive model for heart disease using various machine learning techniques. This project aims to identify the likelihood of heart disease based on patient data.
   - **Key Topics**: Data Preprocessing, Model Training, Evaluation Metrics.
   - **Dataset**:  ([Heart Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset)).

### KMeans
   - **Description**: Implementation of K-means clustering, including a detailed explanation of the algorithm. It clusters data points into K groups based on their features.Includes a project of clustering Significant Earthquake details whose data was being fetched using API ([Earthquake details]( https://www.data.gov.in/resource/details-significant-earthquakes-took-place-country-national-seismological-network-national)).
   - **Key Topics**: Clustering, Centroid Calculation, Iterative Optimization.

### LogisticRegression
   - **Description**: Application of Logistic Regression for binary classification problems, explaining concepts like sigmoid function and decision boundary.Improved Horse colic project using this concept.

### NaiveBayes.py
   - **Description**: Implementation of the Naive Bayes classifier, a simple yet effective method for classification problems.Include project to clissify whther mail recieved is spam or not.

### Neural_Network
   - **Description**: Basic neural network implementation using Python. This project covers the essential concepts of neural networks, including forward and backward propagation.
   - Includes three Projects:
       1. Classifying Newswires.
       2. Movie reviews.
       3. Predicting House Prices.

### SVM (Support Vector Machines)
   - **Description**: Implementation of Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification problems, with an emphasis on understanding hyperplanes and support vectors.

## Usage

To get started with the repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chitwan6804/Machine_Learning.git
   cd Machine_Learning
   ```

2. **Set Up the Environment**:
   - Ensure that you have Python 3.x installed.
   - Install the required libraries using the following command:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Run the Projects**:
   - Navigate to the specific folder of interest (e.g., `cd Heart Disease`) and run the script using:
     ```bash
     python Heart_disease.py
     ```

4. **Jupyter Notebooks**:
   - If a project is provided as a Jupyter Notebook, you can run it using:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   - This will open Jupyter in your web browser, allowing you to explore the code interactively.
